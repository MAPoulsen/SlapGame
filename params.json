This is a fun little game I started when I was first learning to code.\r\nI created the background using Photoshop and this game has 10 different gifs. Each gif has somewhere between 4-23 images.\r\nThis game uses HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. \r\n\r\nI felt like this was a unique opportunity to employ some of my own interests and themes within my designs. I decided to use a creepy vintage circus theme. I found many vintage images of side show actors, banners, tents, etc. and used them in this game. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n",
